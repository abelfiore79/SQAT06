# SQAT06 - Assignment 1
# steps to start a selenium project
# first step is to install node.js onto your system from the nodejs.org website (this will install npm on your system as well)
# then you must install webdriverio onto your system through npm using npm  install webdriver.io
# after you must install selenim-standalone through npm using the command npm install selenium-standalone -g to install globally
# then you create a directoty on your computer that will hold all the nessecary files for the test
# once you have the diecrtory on your system, install selenium-standalone and webdriverio locally on the diecrtory
# you must have a package.json file in your project folder so that your framework is defined
# you will write a javascript file for the script you want to execute, saving the file with a .js file
# once you have written the script, you have to run the script through selenium
# you will then go to command prompt and start a selenium server by entering selenium-standalone start
# then you will execute the file using node filename.js
